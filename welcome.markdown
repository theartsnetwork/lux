| Instantly recognisable (if you have an established brand) | Can be a tricky logo type for new companies          |
| Compact                                                   | Customers can fall for counterfeits in the beginning |

## What things to consider while taking an ideal logo design approach? 
- What image to choose? 
- This image will stick with your company its entire existence
- Play with your Brand name or your name 
- Create deeper meaning 
- Explain visually what your brand does? (
- Evoke an emotion (Your brand should also be likeable hence the logo can evoke some kind of emotion, Logo can be Inspiring, or Cute or Adorable) 

Our next category is also visually representing the brand in a compact or concise order and can be used to create deeper meaning and evoke an emotion. 

## **Abstract Iconography**

Abstract logos allow you to create something truly unique to represent your brand.

## **Logo System** 

Brands can use mix of the two of the above or all of the above to communicate their brand. Examples of Logo or Design Systems can be MTV, Google Doodle and Most recent AirBNB. 

**MTV Framework**

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A8B449F2BA022281574748720D58EF7F4671204547EB94B2D1BB580425F05933_1560421155801_xs27unc0vih21.jpg)


In the 1980s, MTV came up with changing logo type. This dynamism defined the brand and delivered edgy MTV brand message to its audience mostly youth. Thanks to surge of CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CGI (Computer Generated Image), screens could be popped-up with colourful content. Before digital screens, this manipulation wouldn’t have been possible.

**Google Doodle**
What’s a Google Doodle? 
It’s an illustration or animation placed on the Google home page to commemorate or celebrate various anniversaries, festivals, people and ideas.   

It extends the MTV story of connecting with the audience through dynamic yet consistent brand identity. It’s like the brand new cloths every now and then for brands.

Pros and Cons of using such an approach to logo design 

| Pros                                                                  | Cons                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can make a striking impact because of their distinct traditional look | Can be less versatile ( they lean towards higher detail, and the fact that the name and symbol are rigidly entwined) |
| Can convey a classic style                                            | Won’t be easy to replicate across all branding                                                                       |
| Can work for details-loving brands                                    | Complex emblem may shrink so small and it becomes too difficult to read                                              |


~~Show Examples of memorable brand icons.~~ 

Now some brands are bound to play with mix of 2 or more of the above to complete their brand identity. Let’s see the examples of combination types. 


![](https://99designs-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/burger-king.png?auto=format&q=60&fit=max&w=930)


A **combination mark** is a great choice for pretty much any business out there. It’s versatile, usually highly unique, and the most popular choice of logo among prominent companies. 

# A Brief History of Logo Design (Medival Emblems to Coca-Cola to Netflix)

We could track back the idea of logo in Egyptian symbols when we had Feros, Queens and Pyramids in making. In the High Middle Ages (900 – 1300 AD), population started to grow, leading more and more people to move to cities. Since most people could not read or write the visual communication was used and emblems of certain families and dynasties were first popularised. Those early symbols can be considered very early logos.

Europe in 1800’s, mass production of printed material further developed the logo story and in mid 1800s when the printing technology came to United States, the Coca-Cola happened.

Observe how type/typography Coca-Cola remained same over the years. The story is this Coca-Cola type was written. Frank Mason Robinson suggested the name Coca-Cola because 2 c’s will look good in advertising. He also designed the original Coca-Cola logo with a cursive script.  

Let’s see how logo evolves with time and how true spirit of the brand is preserved over multiple years even decades.

Let’s watch a video about story behind its new logo.

**Post War America** 
In 1956, Paul Rand designed the iconic, pictographic IBM logo featuring a human eye and a bee.

The logo was designed by graphic designer [Milton Glaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Glaser) in 1976 in the back of a taxi and was drawn with red crayon on scrap paper[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_New_York#cite_note-5). The original drawing is held in the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. It was designed for a marketing campaign for the New York State Department of Commerce.
